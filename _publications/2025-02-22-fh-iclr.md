Optimization methods are widely employed in deep learning to address and mitigate undesired model responses. While gradient-based techniques have proven effective for image models, their application to language models is hindered by the discrete nature of the input space. This study introduces a novel optimization approach, termed the functional homotopy method, which leverages the functional duality between model training and input generation. By constructing a series of easy-to-hard optimization problems, we iteratively solve these using principles derived from established homotopy methods. We apply this approach to jailbreak attack synthesis for large language models (LLMs), achieving a 20%-30% improvement in success rate over existing methods in circumventing established safe open-source models such as Llama-2 and Llama-3.
