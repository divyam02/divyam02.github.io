Visual data analytics is increasingly becoming an important part of wildlife monitoring and conservation strategies. In this work, we discuss our solution to the image-based Amur tiger re-identification (Re-ID) challenge hosted by the CVWC Workshop at ICCV 2019. Various factors like poor quality images, lighting and pose variations, and limited images per identity make tiger Re-ID a difficult task for deep learning models. Consequently, we propose to utilize both deep learning and traditional SIFT descriptor-based matching for tiger re-identification.
