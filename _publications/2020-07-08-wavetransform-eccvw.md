We introduce a novel class of adversarial attacks, namely ‘WaveTransform’, that creates adversarial noise corresponding to low-frequency and high-frequency subbands, separately (or in combination). The frequency subbands are analyzed using wavelet decomposition; the subbands are corrupted and then used to construct an adversarial example.
