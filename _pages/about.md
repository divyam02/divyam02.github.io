I am a Research Fellow (pre-doctoral researcher) working full time at Microsoft Research (MSR) with [Dr. Nagarajan Natarajan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nagarajn/) and [Dr. Jayashree Mohan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jamohan/), where I apply machine learning to problems in the area of systems. I have recently become interested in generative modelling, low-resource and low-latency inference, robustness and security. In general, I am interested in machine learning and its applications towards other areas, such as computer vision.
