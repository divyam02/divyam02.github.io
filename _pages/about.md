I am a first year PhD student UW-Madison, where I work with [Prof. Somesh Jha](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jha/) on topics pertaining to robustness and security in machine learning. ML Models are vulnerable at many stages of a typical pipeline and can be exploited to produce abberant behavior. This can range from anywhere between installing backdoors during training to duplicating model weights during inference. As these models (especially LLMs) become widespread, I hope to mitigate some of the vulnerabilities that come with them. 

I was previously a Research Fellow (pre-doctoral researcher) at Microsoft Research with [Dr. Nagarajan Natarajan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nagarajn/) and [Dr. Jayashree Mohan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jamohan/), where I applied machine learning to problems in the area of systems, such as network path simulation and efficient inference in LLMs. 

A few years ago, I graduated from [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/) with a B.Tech. in computer science and applied mathematics, where I worked on adversarial robustness with [Prof. Mayank Vatsa](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~mvatsa/) and [Prof. Richa Singh](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~richa/).

<h2>Other things about me</h2>

Outside of academics, I love reading and learning new things, which has led to many-a-fall down rabbit holes on the internet. The topic doesn't really matter, as long as it is something interesting. I have read enough sci-fi and fantasy that I feel compelled to craft a story out of my own ideas, starting with short stories in a setting of my design. I really like instrumental music, which mostly comes from having played far too many video games with awesome OSTs. Speaking of which, I also enjoy playing boardgames, particularly RPGs like D&D. I also learnt the tabla a while back and picked up the violin more recently. I am always up for a jamming session. I have also picked up knitting, but with far less success (grandmothers make it look so easy &#128516).
